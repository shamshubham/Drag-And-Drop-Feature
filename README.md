## Introduction

This project showcases a simple implementation of the drag-and-drop functionality, which is a common feature in web applications. It allows users to drag list items from one box and drop them into another. The project is a minimal example to help understand the basics of the drag-and-drop API in JavaScript.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd drag-and-drop-feature
   ```

2. **Open the Project**:

   Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the drag-and-drop feature.

## Usage

1. **Drag Items**:

   - Click and hold any item under the "left" container.
   - Drag the item over to the "right" container and release it to drop.

2. **Move Items Back**:

   - Items can also be dragged back from the "right" container to the "left" container.

## Code Overview

### 1. HTML Structure

The `index.html` file sets up the basic structure of the page, including two containers (`left` and `right`) where the draggable items are placed. Each item has the `draggable="true"` attribute to enable dragging.

### 2. CSS Styling

The styles in `style.css` (not provided here) define the layout and appearance of the containers and list items.

### 3. JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript code enables the drag-and-drop functionality:

- **Selecting Elements**: The `document.getElementsByClassName("list")` and `document.getElementById()` methods are used to select the draggable items and drop areas.
- **Drag Events**: Event listeners for `dragstart`, `dragover`, and `drop` are set up to manage the drag-and-drop process.
- **Drag and Drop Logic**: During the `dragstart` event, the selected item is stored. The `dragover` event prevents the default handling, allowing the item to be dropped. The `drop` event moves the item to the new container.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and layout of the application.
- **CSS3**: Styling and positioning of elements.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for implementing the drag-and-drop feature.
